## Overview

The posh shell is a cross platform shell written in python meant to be a partial substitute for
other shells like bash, zsh, powershell, etc. It implements many of the commands like 'mv', 'rm',
'cp', etc, and if the command hasn't yet been implemented, you can access your operating system's
underlying shell using the 'run' command.
